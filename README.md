# Contentstack Extensions

Contentstack provides Extensions that let you extend its UI. It provides four types of extensions: Custom Fields, Custom Widgets, Dashboard Widgets and JSON RTE Plugin.

The **Custom Fields** extension lets you create custom fields that you can use in your content types, such as a color picker, code editor, video selector, and more.

The **Custom Widgets** extension lets you add widgets that help you analyze the content of an entry and recommend content ideas. Examples of custom widgets are SEO recommendations, sentiment analysis, and content translation in different languages.

The **Dashboard Widgets extension** allows you to add widgets to the dashboard of your stack. Using this extension, you can create useful widgets such as recently published content, to-do list, personal notes, stack summary, and more.

The **JSON Rich Text Editor Plugins** lets you add/create custom plugins to extend the functionality of your JSON Rich Text Editor as per your needs. You can use the prebuilt JSON RTE plugins by modifying the code to suit your requirement. Some of the basic prebuilt plugins include Highlight, Info Panel, and Word Count. 


This is a repository of example extensions created using Contentstackâ€™s [App SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@contentstack/app-sdk) for JSON RTE Plugins and for others [Extensions SDK](https://github.com/contentstack/ui-extensions-sdk).
